# RNN-vs-LSTM-vs-GRU
Difference between SimpleRNN, LSTM and GRU


## Problem Description

Classifying movie reviews: a binary classification example. Two-class classification, or binary classification, may be the most widely applied kind of machine-learning problem.

Here, we will see how SimpleRNN, LSTM and GRU perform at classifying movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.
